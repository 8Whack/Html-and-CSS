    <h1>Is Hunt:Showdown the best FPS game around?</h1>
   
<p>I've been playing Hunt:Showdown for the last six months, and it has 
    quickly risen to the top of my favorite games. This old-timey feeling,
    bounty-hunting, cowboy-styled game stands out for a lot of different reasons.</p>
    <p>Why, you might ask? Well, the answer is simple- it's the most natural,
        realistic shooter game for the casual player! It hits that sweet spot 
        between hardcore FPS games (like Escape from Tarkov) and casual shooters
        (such as Overwatch), all while having a much more intuitive way to bring 
        players together than every other battle royale.
    </p>
    <h2>How hardcore is it?</h2>
    <p>While this game is still classified as a hardcore shooter, it's a lot 
        less punishing than others in its genre, which makes it much more friendly 
        to newer users. If you're a new player coming from a casual background, 
        the first thing you'll notice is the lack of a crosshair. Instead, you
        need to use the actual iron sights on the gun to aim. You'll also notice
        that your guns don't automatically reload when you're out of ammunition- 
        you have to reload automatically. These two things do take some getting 
        used to, but I quickly grew to love them- I feel like it quickly made me 
        feel like I was actually shooting the guns myself, and I loved how 
        realistic it was.

    <h2>If there's no ring/storm, how to players find each other?</h2>
    <p>In Hunt:Showdown, the goal is to find an in-game boss, kill it, and 
        take the bounty that it drops upon death to one of the map's extraction
        points. To that end, as players explore the map they find clues that lead 
        to the boss- and as everyone hones in on the boss's location, teams start 
        to run into each other. Since only one team can get the bounty, the goal 
        then becomes to eliminate the other teams- because if you don't, they'll 
        eliminate you. This way of bringing the players together feels so much 
        more natural and realistic than just having a ring force everyone together, 
        and it lets you choose when and where you choose to fight- which allows
        for another realm of skill for you and your team.
